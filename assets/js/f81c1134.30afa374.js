Controllability Matrix\\n\\nFor a linear system\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t),\\n$$\\n\\nthe **controllability matrix** is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{C} = [B, AB, A^2B, \\\\dots, A^{n-1}B].\\n$$\\n\\n* The system is controllable if\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\text{rank}(\\\\mathcal{C}) = n.\\n  $$\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 **Interpretation:** This matrix checks whether inputs can span the entire state space.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 **Limitation:** It only gives a binary answer (controllable or not), without quantifying how easy it is to control.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Observability Matrix\\n\\nFor the system output\\n\\n$$\\ny(t) = Cx(t),\\n$$\\n\\nthe **observability matrix** is\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathcal{O} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\\\\\ CA \\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\ CA^{n-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}.\\n$$\\n\\n* The system is observable if\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\text{rank}(\\\\mathcal{O}) = n.\\n  $$\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 **Interpretation:** It checks whether outputs provide enough information to reconstruct the entire state.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 **Limitation:** Like controllability matrix, it does not measure the degree of observability.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Controllability Gramian\\n\\nIf the system is stable, the **controllability Gramian** is defined as\\n\\n$$\\nW_c = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{A\\\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T \\\\tau} d\\\\tau.\\n$$\\n\\nIt satisfies the Lyapunov equation:\\n\\n$$\\nA W_c + W_c A^T + B B^T = 0.\\n$$\\n\\n* The system is controllable if $W_c$ is positive definite.\\n* The minimum control energy to reach a state $x_T$ is\\n\\n  $$\\n  E_{\\\\min}(x_T) = x_T^T W_c^{-1} x_T.\\n  $$\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 **Interpretation:** The Gramian describes how much input energy is needed to move the system in each state direction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Observability Gramian\\n\\nThe **observability Gramian** is defined as\\n\\n$$\\nW_o = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{A^T\\\\tau} C^T C e^{A\\\\tau} d\\\\tau,\\n$$\\n\\nand satisfies\\n\\n$$\\nA^T W_o + W_o A + C^T C = 0.\\n$$\\n\\n* The system is observable if $W_o$ is positive definite.\\n* $x^T W_o x$ measures how much output energy is generated from the state $x$.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 **Interpretation:** The Gramian quantifies how \u201cvisible\u201d different state directions are from the outputs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Matrix vs Gramian\\n\\n| Tool                                 | Purpose                  | Criterion                    | Meaning                               | Limitation         |\\n| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |\\n| Controllability Matrix $\\\\mathcal{C}$ | Check controllability    | $\\\\text{rank}(\\\\mathcal{C})=n$ | Can input affect all states?          | Only Yes/No        |\\n| Observability Matrix $\\\\mathcal{O}$   | Check observability      | $\\\\text{rank}(\\\\mathcal{O})=n$ | Can output reveal all states?         | Only Yes/No        |\\n| Controllability Gramian $W_c$        | Quantify controllability | $W_c > 0$                    | Input energy required to reach states | Requires stability |\\n| Observability Gramian $W_o$          | Quantify observability   | $W_o > 0$                    | Output energy generated by states     | Requires stability |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Conclusion\\n\\n* **Matrices** (controllability/observability) \u2192 algebraic tools for a **binary test**.\\n* **Gramians** (controllability/observability) \u2192 energy-based tools for a **quantitative measure**.\\n* Both are equivalent in deciding controllability and observability, but Gramians are essential in advanced applications such as:\\n\\n  * **Optimal control** (minimum-energy control problems)\\n  * **Model reduction** (balanced truncation)\\n  * **System sensitivity analysis**\\n\\n---\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 In short:\\n\\n* **Matrices** tell you **if** the system is controllable/observable.\\n* **Gramians** tell you **how much** control or observation effort is required."}]}}')}}]);
